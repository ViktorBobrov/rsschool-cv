## Short information
hello, my name is victor and i'm a development engineer in the mining industry, but recently I've taken up the study of front-end development.
I am interested in this direction by the ability to create beautiful sites and the possibility of convenient functionality, which is now difficult to find anywhere.
I have no commercial development experience, but I have a great desire to develop in this area.

In my work I use html, CSS, JavaScript (Beginner),BAM-metodology,GITHUB.
I am using VS code to write the code.

## Code examples
```function multiply(a, b){
return  a * b
}
```

## Work experience
